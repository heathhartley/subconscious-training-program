# TrainSmart

TrainSmart is a full-stack training plan generator that combines a modern React + TypeScript frontend with an AI-powered backend. Users can describe the type of training plan they want, optionally connect Strava, and receive a personalized multi-week training schedule generated by an AI agent.

This project was built as a take-home assignment and is designed to demonstrate frontend architecture, backend integration, API design, and thoughtful tradeoffs around deployment and iteration speed.

## Overview

**What TrainSmart does:**

- Allows users to describe a training goal in natural language
- Generates a personalized, multi-week training plan using an AI agent
- Supports Strava integration so historical training data can inform the plan
- Displays training plans in a clean, responsive UI with week-by-week navigation

**High-level architecture:**

- React + TypeScript frontend
- FastAPI backend
- AI agent powered by the Subconscious API
- Deployed using lightweight AWS services for speed and simplicity

## Frontend

### Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Icons
- Framer Motion

### Features

- Text-based training goal input
- Preset goal shortcuts (speed, strength, weight loss, etc.)
- Horizontally scrollable week selector (mobile + desktop friendly)
- Clean, accessible UI with subtle animations
- Disabled but intentional UI for upcoming integrations (Apple Health, Garmin)

### Running Locally

To install dependencies and start the frontend locally:
``` 
npm install
npm run dev
```


### Deployment

- Deployed to **AWS S3** for quick static hosting
- Future iterations would use:
  - **CloudFront** for CDN and HTTPS
  - **Route 53** with a custom domain

The current approach prioritizes fast iteration over production-grade infrastructure.

## Backend

### Tech Stack

- FastAPI
- Python
- Subconscious API
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Responsibilities

- Accepts training plan requests from the frontend
- Uses prompt engineering to instruct the AI agent
- Orchestrates AI responses into a structured training plan
- Exposes polling endpoints so the frontend can track generation progress

### AI Agent Behavior

When generating a plan, the AI agent:

- Receives the user’s goal and instructions
- Is informed that it *may* call external data sources
- Can call a `/strava` endpoint to retrieve training history

### Strava Integration (Current State)

- The `/strava` endpoint currently returns **mock data**
- This was an intentional choice for the take-home assignment to:
  - Demonstrate system design
  - Avoid OAuth complexity
  - Keep the focus on architecture and AI orchestration

### Future Integrations

- Garmin
- Apple Health

The backend is designed so additional data sources can be added without changing the frontend contract.

### Deployment

- Deployed using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- Chosen for:
  - Simple configuration
  - Fast deployments
  - Minimal operational overhead

## Design Decisions & Tradeoffs

- **S3 over CloudFront**: faster to ship for a take-home; easy to upgrade later
- **Polling instead of WebSockets**: simpler, sufficient for generation latency
- **Mocked Strava data**: keeps focus on architecture and AI flow
- **Single repo**: easier to review and reason about in an interview context
- **Strong typing (TypeScript)**: improves maintainability and confidence when rendering AI-generated data

---

## Future Improvements

- Real OAuth flow for Strava
- Apple Health & Garmin integrations
- CloudFront + custom domain
- Persistent user accounts
- Training plan editing & regeneration
- Progress tracking and plan adjustments over time
